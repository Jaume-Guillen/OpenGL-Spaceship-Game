# OpenGL-Spaceship-Game
Game where you control a spaceship travelling through an infinite tunnel. Move with WASD and avoid the different obstacles to make the highscore!
Installation: You need a server to run this game.We used XAMPP with an Apache Server (port 80). You need to put the game in the xampp folder in the C:/ disk. Put both zips uncompressed inside a folder called whatever you want and it should run correctly.
